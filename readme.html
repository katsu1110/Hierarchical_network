SUMMARY:

This program implements the model of: K Wimmer, A Compte, A Roxin, D
Peixoto, A Renart & J de la Rocha. Sensory integration dynamics in a
hierarchical network explains choice probabilities in cortical area
MT. Nat. Commun. 6:6177 doi: 10.1038/ncomms7177 (2015).

A complete description of the model is provided in the methods of the
paper and the supplementary material (in particular the Supplementary
Tables 1-4).

The program runs a single simulation and outputs a figure, similar to
the one shown in Fig 1b in the paper:

The code is not at all optimized in order to keep it simple, clean and
platform independent. Depending on your CPU, the execution can take
several minutes.

REQUIREMENTS: You will need Python and
the <a href="http://www.briansimulator.org">Brian simulator</a>
installed. Plotting requires matplotlib, a Python plotting library.


USE:
To run the simulation, just execute the command:

python run_hierarchical_model.py
